# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** built using Python.  
It combines **Content-Based Filtering**, **Collaborative Filtering**, and a **Hybrid Model** to provide top movie suggestions.

## 📌 Features
- Data cleaning, preprocessing, and **EDA** with visualizations.
- Content-based recommendations using **TF-IDF vectorization**.
- Collaborative filtering using **Cosine Similarity** and **Matrix Factorization (SVD)**.
- Hybrid model combining multiple techniques for better accuracy.
- Models are **trained, tested, evaluated**, and provide personalized **Top 10 movie recommendations** based on parameters like genre, actors, ratings, and directors.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack / Libraries
- Python 3
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- SciPy
